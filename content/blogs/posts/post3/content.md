description: 'As walking is one of the simplest — and most accessible — forms of exercise, if you begin walking for fitness and are hoping to speed up results and make the activity more challenging, it may seem harmless to just add in some weights.'
para:
  - First and foremost, even though walking is something we do every day, before you start a walking routine, you should, of course, consult your doctor. Getting a regular checkup before doing cardiovascular work helps ensure your heart and lungs are at their healthiest and can effectively handle the stress of added physical activity.
  - When out and about, you may have seen people in your neighborhood or local park walking and carrying a set of weights and thought it seemed like a practical way to add strength training while getting cardio. However, because these are separate types of exercise, in this case, it may be in your best interest to treat it as such.
  - “When done correctly, walking is an effective, low-impact, low-risk exercise,” says Mark Sullivan, who provides personal, one-on-one e-coaching and counseling for runners, walkers and multi-sport athletes at iRuniCoach.com. “It is not, however, especially efficient for burning calories. While adding weights will definitely increase the calorie burning, walking with weights may also increase your risk of injury and may even cause unexpected side effects like back pain or an increase in blood pressure.”
  - Carrying weights in your hands can actually cause a postural imbalance and put added stress on your shoulders and neck. During a single walk, this may not be too much of an issue, but over time it can cause added stress to your joints. If you choose ankle weights, you can put added stress on your ankles and knees.
  - “Weight training is a much better option to walking with weights,” explains Burningham. “For example instead of walking with weights, you could start with some knee-down pushups, tricep dips, unweighted squats or a modified wall sit to begin to build strength.”
