  - Holidays can be challenging for many reasons — the stress, family dynamics, travel and even the food. Hear me out — holiday food is delicious and special. But, if I had a nickel for every client who came into our sessions with worries about how to eat during the holidays, I would have a lot of nickels. And that’s because, along with the cookie recipes, cocktail parties and family dinners, there’s diet culture messaging declaring you “bad” for enjoying holiday treats. Or, the only way to be “good” and stay on your diet is to restrict foods or exercise like crazy to “make up” for a holiday meal. I am here to say enough of that. Here are my tips for how to enjoy holiday meals with as little nonsensical diet culture influence as possible.
  - One of the most important things you can do for your body during the holidays (and all days) is to eat consistently. No more of that “I’ll just starve all day to ‘save up’ for a big dinner” nonsense. That is a recipe for disaster in which you overeat because you’re so hungry, feel extremely full, and then guilty and shameful for what you ate and how you feel. Providing your body with a consistent source of energy is crucial for keeping energy levels up and avoiding a blood sugar crash that can result in the worst holiday “hanger.” Make it a point to have breakfast every day, bring snacks if you’ll be out and about, and try not to go longer than 3–4 hours without eating anything.
  - This one sounds simple, but drinking enough fluids (and no I do not mean cocktails) is often overlooked among busy and irregular schedules. Not drinking enough fluids can lead to constipation, bloating, fatigue and headaches. All of these can factor into food choices and make holiday meals more complicated. Try to aim for at least 2 liters of fluid per day (water, tea, seltzer) to help keep your body hydrated and operating optimally. Carry around a reusable bottle if you’ll be on the go all day, or record cups or ounces consumed in an app to help keep you on track.
